Here we will provide step by step guide on how to install Python on your PC. Here we will show you how to install Python 3.5.2 for Mac operating system. Follow the guide below. There is a difference between Python2 and Python3. We prefer and also recommend users to get familiar with Python3. Since there are significant changes in features as well as coding in the two versions of Python. It is recommended to stick to the latest release.

**NOTE:** Python comes already installed on Mac OS X. Although you can make sure you have the latest version of Python by installing the current build from the Python website.

**NOTE: Article was written when Python 3.5.2 was the latest version of Python. Procedure to install versions above 3.5.2 is same.**
