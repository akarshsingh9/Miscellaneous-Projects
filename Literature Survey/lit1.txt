title: Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context
Method: a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in 
	object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding.
	Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in
	precise object localization. Algorithms like Bounding box and segmentation detection
	improves object detection in Microsoft COCO when compared to ImageNet, PASCAL and SUN.
Remarks:
Advantage: Improved object detection and recognition in Microsoft COCO's dataset
Disadvatage: Less number of categories in comparision to ImageNet and SUN

title: Fast R-CNN
Method: This paper proposes a Fast Region-based Convolutional Network method (Fast R-CNN) 
	for object detection. Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals 
	using deep convolutional networks. Compared to previous work, 
	Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also 
	increasing detection accuracy.
Remarks:
Advantage: Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time
Disadvantage:  Swamping the deep classifier with more proposals does not help, and even slightly hurts accuracy.

title: Faster r-cnn: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks
Method: Region Proposal Network (RPN) merged with Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their 
	convolutional features using attention mechanisms. RPN components tell this unified network where to look.
Remarks: 
Advantage: Performance better than Fast R-CNN takes 10ms per image for object detection.
